1. implement lodash/fp get:
get('a.b.c', x);
get('a.b.c')(x);


2. You are given two non-empty arrays representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their element contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as an array.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
Input: arr1 = [2,4,3], arr2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.


3. Implement Promise.all, no need to take care of rejections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. implement React.useCallback using React.useRef (the candidate will share his screen while working in react playground)


5. implement useIsMouseMoving hook
the function signature will be useIsMouseMoving(): boolean
the hook should return a boolean state that is true when the mouse is moving and false when it is not
(the candidate will share his screen while working in react playground)


6. explain what problem list virtualization solves and describe how it does it (theoretical question)


7. React component tree re-rendering and performance issue solving exercise (link to the exercise in react playground, the candidate will share his screen while working)
